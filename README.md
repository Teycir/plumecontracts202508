# Plume Network Security Audit Contributions

This repository showcases my independent security research on Plume Network's smart contract ecosystem. Through manual analysis, static scanning, and custom proof-of-concept (PoC) development, I identified and responsibly disclosed **5 high-impact vulnerabilities** to Immunefi during their pre-deployment Attackathon contest. All findings were submitted before the contracts went live, preventing potential exploits in a live environment.

## Disclosure Statement

These vulnerabilities were reported to Immunefi as part of the Plume Network Attackathon scope, focusing on critical issues like protocol insolvency and treasury drains. Despite detailed PoCs demonstrating concrete financial impact and alignment with CVSS standards, the reports were dismissed with feedback citing ["automated scanner output without demonstrating valid issues"](https://ibb.co/twFZmXb) and "lacking required vulnerability impact information." All reports were [closed without review](https://ibb.co/tpJFv5v). 

This public disclosure addresses those concerns by providing:
- **Manual vulnerability analysis** beyond automated tools
- **Quantified financial impact** with specific ETH amounts at risk
- **Executable proof-of-concepts** demonstrating real exploitability
- **Detailed remediation guidance** with code examples

This disclosure is for educational purposes, highlighting novel findings not covered in prior audits. No live exploits are enabled; Plume remains in testnet phase, allowing time for verification and fixes.

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Total Funds at Risk | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Critical** | 3 | ~200,000+ ETH | ✅ Disclosed |
| **High** | 2 | Variable | ✅ Disclosed |
| **Total** | **5** | **200,000+ ETH** | **Pre-deployment** |

## Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 1. Oracle Manipulation via Malicious Deployment
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 10.0 | **Impact**: Complete treasury drain

- **Root Cause**: Unvalidated `supraRouterAddress` parameter grants SUPRA_ROLE to arbitrary addresses during initialization
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious deployer becomes VRF oracle, guarantees jackpot wins
- **Funds at Risk**: Up to 100,000 ETH (week 11 maximum jackpot) + entire treasury
- **PoC**: Complete treasury drain demonstration with proper VRF mocking

### 2. Whitelist Bypass of Daily Spin Limits
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 9.0 | **Impact**: Unlimited daily exploitation

- **Root Cause**: `canSpin()` modifier returns early for whitelisted addresses without daily limit checks
- **Attack Vector**: Whitelisted users can perform unlimited spins per day
- **Funds at Risk**: Entire treasury via unlimited jackpot attempts + fee siphoning
- **PoC**: 20+ spins executed in single day, bypassing intended daily limits

### 3. Wrong Asset Transfer (ETH vs PLUME ERC-20)
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 9.9 | **Impact**: Asset-type confusion

- **Root Cause**: `_safeTransferPlume()` sends native ETH instead of PLUME ERC-20 tokens
- **Attack Vector**: "Plume Token" rewards drain ETH treasury while recording phantom token balances
- **Funds at Risk**: Entire ETH balance held by contract
- **PoC**: Asset confusion demonstrated with proper accounting verification

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. Unprotected Implementation Contract Initialization
**Contract**: `Raffle.sol` | **CVSS**: 8.2 | **Impact**: Implementation takeover

- **Root Cause**: Implementation contract deployed without `_disableInitializers()`
- **Attack Vector**: Anyone can initialize implementation and gain admin control
- **Risk**: Split control scenarios, potential fund theft via upgrade mechanism
- **PoC**: Complete implementation takeover with financial impact demonstration

### 5. Weak Access Control in Oracle Callback
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 8.0 | **Impact**: Systematic outcome manipulation

- **Root Cause**: `handleRandomness()` lacks nonce validation and request verification
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious oracle can dictate arbitrary outcomes with crafted RNG
- **Risk**: Guaranteed reward manipulation, systematic treasury drain
- **PoC**: Multi-vector exploitation including nonce manipulation and outcome control

## Technical Methodology

### Analysis Approach
- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive contract review using Slither, Aderyn, and manual analysis
- **Dynamic Testing**: Foundry-based PoC development with realistic attack scenarios
- **Economic Modeling**: Treasury drain calculations and profit/loss analysis
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-contract interaction vulnerability assessment

### Tools & Frameworks Used
- **Foundry**: Advanced testing framework for PoC development
- **Slither**: Static analysis for vulnerability detection
- **Aderyn**: Rust-based security scanner
- **Custom Scripts**: Automated contract analysis and report generation

### Proof of Concept Quality
- ✅ **Executable**: All PoCs run with `forge test` commands
- ✅ **Realistic**: Proper VRF mocking and contract interaction
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Multiple attack vectors per vulnerability
- ✅ **Measurable**: Gas costs, profit calculations, and impact quantification
