# Security Audit Contributions

This repository contains comprehensive security research conducted on Plume Network's smart contract ecosystem. Through systematic analysis and proof-of-concept development, I identified and responsibly disclosed **5 high-impact vulnerabilities** to Immunefi before the contracts went live.

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Total Funds at Risk | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Critical** | 3 | ~200,000+ ETH | ✅ Disclosed |
| **High** | 2 | Variable | ✅ Disclosed |
| **Total** | **5** | **200,000+ ETH** | **Pre-deployment** |

## Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 1. Oracle Manipulation via Malicious Deployment
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 10.0 | **Impact**: Complete treasury drain

- **Root Cause**: Unvalidated `supraRouterAddress` parameter grants SUPRA_ROLE to arbitrary addresses during initialization
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious deployer becomes VRF oracle, guarantees jackpot wins
- **Funds at Risk**: Up to 100,000 ETH (week 11 maximum jackpot) + entire treasury
- **PoC**: Complete treasury drain demonstration with proper VRF mocking

### 2. Whitelist Bypass of Daily Spin Limits
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 9.0 | **Impact**: Unlimited daily exploitation

- **Root Cause**: `canSpin()` modifier returns early for whitelisted addresses without daily limit checks
- **Attack Vector**: Whitelisted users can perform unlimited spins per day
- **Funds at Risk**: Entire treasury via unlimited jackpot attempts + fee siphoning
- **PoC**: 20+ spins executed in single day, bypassing intended daily limits

### 3. Wrong Asset Transfer (ETH vs PLUME ERC-20)
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 9.9 | **Impact**: Asset-type confusion

- **Root Cause**: `_safeTransferPlume()` sends native ETH instead of PLUME ERC-20 tokens
- **Attack Vector**: "Plume Token" rewards drain ETH treasury while recording phantom token balances
- **Funds at Risk**: Entire ETH balance held by contract
- **PoC**: Asset confusion demonstrated with proper accounting verification

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. Unprotected Implementation Contract Initialization
**Contract**: `Raffle.sol` | **CVSS**: 8.2 | **Impact**: Implementation takeover

- **Root Cause**: Implementation contract deployed without `_disableInitializers()`
- **Attack Vector**: Anyone can initialize implementation and gain admin control
- **Risk**: Split control scenarios, potential fund theft via upgrade mechanism
- **PoC**: Complete implementation takeover with financial impact demonstration

### 5. Weak Access Control in Oracle Callback
**Contract**: `Spin.sol` | **CVSS**: 8.0 | **Impact**: Systematic outcome manipulation

- **Root Cause**: `handleRandomness()` lacks nonce validation and request verification
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious oracle can dictate arbitrary outcomes with crafted RNG
- **Risk**: Guaranteed reward manipulation, systematic treasury drain
- **PoC**: Multi-vector exploitation including nonce manipulation and outcome control

## Technical Methodology

### Analysis Approach
- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive contract review using Slither, Aderyn, and manual analysis
- **Dynamic Testing**: Foundry-based PoC development with realistic attack scenarios
- **Economic Modeling**: Treasury drain calculations and profit/loss analysis
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-contract interaction vulnerability assessment

### Tools & Frameworks Used
- **Foundry**: Advanced testing framework for PoC development
- **Slither**: Static analysis for vulnerability detection
- **Aderyn**: Rust-based security scanner
- **Custom Scripts**: Automated contract analysis and report generation

### Proof of Concept Quality
- ✅ **Executable**: All PoCs run with `forge test` commands
- ✅ **Realistic**: Proper VRF mocking and contract interaction
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Multiple attack vectors per vulnerability
- ✅ **Measurable**: Gas costs, profit calculations, and impact quantification
